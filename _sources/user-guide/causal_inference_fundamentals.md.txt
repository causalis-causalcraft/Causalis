# Causal Inference Intuition
As humans, we intuitively understand cause and effect relationships. 
Without this understanding, we would not have been able to survive 
and achieve our current level of development.

How do we usually think about whether a given impact is a cause?
* It's simple, in our heads we check whether the impact was there 
before we saw the effect
* We also check whether the impact has a large force capable of 
influencing the effect. In other words, are there other factors 
that have had a stronger effect than the impact?

Now you have a simple model of casual inference in your head.

# Formalization

In both industry and academia, the use of universal notation 
for causal inference serves as a critical tool for enhancing 
communication among researchers and practitioners.

**Units** are typically the people, companies or households on 
which we are analyzing the impact.

$$ i = 1, \ldots, n $$

**Treatment** is an effect, in data we usually see it as 1 if 
it was there and 0 if it was not there. (This generalizes to 
multi-valued or continuous treatments.)

$$ T_i \in \{0, 1\} $$

**Outcome** is the variable by which we measure the effect. For example, 
temperature, if we are testing a drug, or the probability of buying a 
product if we are changing the landing page

$$ Y_i $$

**Covariates or confounders**. These are variables that influence the
propensity to receive a treatment and simultaneously predict the target, 
thereby causing bias in the estimate.

$$ X_i $$

It could look like this in a data

| Client | Treatment | Outcome | confounder_1 | confounder_2 |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1      | 1         | 100     | 1           | 13          |
| 2      | 0         | 90      | 0           | 14          |
| 3      | 1         | 110     | 1           | 51          |
| 4      | 1         | 97      | 1           | 63          |
| 5      | 0         | 80      | 0           | 34          |
| 6      | 0         | 85      | 0           | 53          |

# Estimation

To understand how to evaluate effects, you need to understand the 
estimands.

## ITE (and CATE)

Question: What is the effect for an individual (ITE) or for people 
like this (CATE)?

$$ \text{ITE}_i \;=\; Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) $$

ITE is fundamentally unobservable for any single unit; we estimate 
its conditional average:)

$$ \tau(x) \;=\; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\,Y(1)-Y(0)\mid X=x\,\right] \quad \text{(CATE)} $$

Use when: personalization, uplift targeting, heterogeneous effects.

## ATT (Average Treatment effect on the Treated)

Question: What was the effect on those who actually received treatment?

$$ \text{ATT} \;=\; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\,Y(1)-Y(0)\mid T=1\,\right] $$

Use when: evaluating past rollouts, “did it work for the treated?”, program 
evaluation where treatment assignment was selective.

## ATE (Average Treatment Effect)

Question: What is the overall average effect in the population?

$$ \text{ATE} \;=\; \mathbb{E}\!\left[\,Y(1)-Y(0)\,\right] $$

Use when: policy decisions affecting the whole eligible population; 
headline effect sizes.
